# PYChallengeGenerator

#This program was inspired by other code challenges as seen on freeCodeCamp.org. 

#Its main purpose is to help beginner programmers gain more hands on experience with developing programs in Python. 

#The PYChallengeGenerator program is dependent on two additional scripts: help.py and ParameterGlossary.py.

#Along with its imported dependencies, PyChallengeCreator.py will generate up to 8 random data types and functions to be included in a program.

#Users can select their assigned parameters from a numbered list in order to get more information on their usage and syntax.

#Until formatting can be properly demonstrated in the syntax examples, users will be the most successful if they are already familiar with 
#the use of indentation and white space in Python programs. 
#See https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/indentation-in-python/ for more information. 

#This is a work in progress and any helpful suggestions for improving run time and string formatting are welcome!
